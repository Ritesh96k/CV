        once u tap on the skill aquired button u are directed to a complete new web page  
        where u will find hyper links of the skills u have aquired. for that u have to first cut
        the list parts with all the hyper links and then create the new HTML file and paste it there .
        after that just create the hyper link with path defined in it so that  when u click on the skill 
        aquaired hyper link it will take u to new web page.
        so now i will take the above procedure in action -->
